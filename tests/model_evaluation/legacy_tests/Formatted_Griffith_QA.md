## 6. What is the process for student registration?

For Griffith College, the student registration process involves the following steps:

Online Registration:

Access the Portal: Students need to access the my.griffith.ie portal using their log-in details.
Follow Instructions: Complete the instructions provided on the portal to finalize registration.
Complete Details: Ensure all personal details and program information are accurate.
Payment of Fees:

Through the portal, students can pay their fees as required.
Access to Resources:

Once registered, students gain access to essential college resources such as Moodle, assessment results, and information on graduation.
Timely Registration:

Students must register online before their program commences.
Failure to register means students will not be able to access Moodle, submit assessments, take examinations, or graduate.
Important Considerations:

Registration ensures that students are officially enrolled with the relevant awarding body for their program (e.g., QQI, BTEC).
Registration also allows students to seek tax relief and access various academic and administrative support services.
Changes to Registration:

Any changes to registration must be processed through the Learner Record Amendment Form (LRAF). This can include changes to personal details, program information, etc.
On-Campus Printer Access (Optional):

If students have a student card, they can tap it on a printer reader to associate it with an account. This step is optional and involves entering email and password information.
Student Etiquette and Attendance:

Students are expected to understand and meet their program’s attendance requirements.
Failure to meet these requirements or communicate attendance difficulties with the faculty can result in withdrawal from the program.
Students who may face attendance difficulties must communicate this with their faculty to avoid potential consequences.

<span style='color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;'>No.</span>

**Explanation:** While the core information about registration is correct and detailed, the final two sections (On-Campus Printer Access and Student Etiquette and Attendance) are unrelated to the registration process and introduce unnecessary content. The answer should focus strictly on the registration steps and implications.

<span style='color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;'>Yes.</span>

It is advised to contact the Student Fees Office to discuss any fee-payment difficulties and to explore the possibility of a payment plan if your account falls into arrears.

<span style='color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;'>Yes.</span>

---

## 10. Is it possible to get a refund on tuition fees?

Based on the provided context from the Griffith College Student Handbook, it is explicitly stated that "It is College policy not to refund fees under any circumstances." Therefore, it is not possible to get a refund on tuition fees once you have registered and become liable for the fees.

17: Good Friday
20: Easter Sunday
21: Easter Monday Bank Holiday
Further clarification would be needed for the exact dates of these events.

<span style='color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;'>No.</span>

**Explanation:** The answer attempts to list specific dates, but many of them are incorrect, inconsistent (e.g. Christmas and Easter dates), or mixed up across academic years (e.g. January 2024 appearing after October 2024). The question only asked for types of key dates, not specific ones. A better answer would summarize that the calendar includes:

Semester start and end dates

Exam periods

Assignment deadlines

Holidays and bank holidays

Graduation dates

Registration windows

Avoid incorrect or mismatched date details unless verified.

---

## 13. When are exam results typically released?

Exam results are typically released after 4 weeks following your final assessment as stated: "Assessment results are normally issued within 4 weeks of your final assessment."

The specific date for the release of provisional exam results is mentioned as: "25 Provisonal exam results released" (As dated on international conventions, it is in the format of day/month), so 25th of the month after Semester 1 ends, provisionary results are released . However, please confirm this date with your program's academic calendar, as there might be variations.

<span style='color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;'>Yes.</span>

---

## 14. What is Moodle used for at Griffith College?

At Griffith College, Moodle is used as the primary Virtual Learning Management System (VLMS) for students. Here are some of its key uses:

Programme Information: It serves as the main resource for programme information.
Lecture Content: Students can find lecture notes and recordings.
Assignments and Assessments: Students can submit assignments, either through a direct upload and/or Turnitin.
Reading Materials: Lecturers might share suggested reading materials.
Course-related Communication: Lecturers may contact students through Moodle about their courses, so it's important for students to log in and check their inbox regularly.
Important Information: It is the place where students will find important information during their study period.
Coversheets and Assessments: This includes coversheets required for both hard copy and soft copy submissions for assignment integrity.
General College Information: Students can find a wealth of information related to college services, policies, and more.
In essence, Moodle is the central hub for student learning and communication at Griffith College.

<span style='color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;'>Yes.</span>

## 15. How can a student regain access to Moodle if locked out?

If a student is locked out of Moodle, there are a few steps they can take to regain access:

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Issues: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is set up correctly. If the student is having trouble with MFA, they should:

Make sure the MS Authenticator app is installed and set up on their mobile phone.
Follow the instructions on the "See Email and Office 365 | Griffith" page to complete the MFA setup.
Fee Issues: Sometimes, access to Moodle may be restricted due to unpaid fees. If this is the case, the student should:

Contact the fees office at studentfees@griff to resolve any outstanding fees.
Email Address Update: If the student’s email address needs to be updated, they should:

Contact their faculty administrator to request an update to their email address.
Module Access Issues: If the student has registered but does not have access to Moodle or is missing modules, they should:

Wait 48 hours after registration.
If they still do not have access, email their course administrator for assistance.
Technical Support: For any other technical issues, students can:

Contact their faculty administrator or the IT support team for further assistance.
By following these steps, students should be able to regain access to Moodle and resolve any issues they are experiencing.

<span style='color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;'>No.</span>

**Explanation:** While most of the information is correct, there's a minor issue with the email domain being cut off (studentfees@griff should be <studentfees@griffith.ie>). Also, some points like "Email Address Update" aren't relevant to resolving Moodle access directly unless it’s a deeper account issue. The answer is mostly solid but slightly overcomplicated and includes an error.

## 16. What is the Wi-Fi password and how often does it change?

The context provided does not contain information about a specific Wi-Fi password, nor does it mention how often a Wi-Fi password changes. However, it discusses the Eunudroam Wi-Fi network, which is used across many educational institutions. Typically, Eduroam does not have a separate password that changes; instead, users connect using their institutional credentials (username and password).

For general information on connecting to Eduroam, including setting it up to connect automatically, you can refer to the Eduroam Wi-Fi network section on Griffith.ie IT step-by-step guides. However, without specific details on the Wi-Fi password and its change frequency, I recommend checking the official Griffith College IT resources or contacting the IT Service Desk for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

To contact the IT Service Desk, you can:

Email: <helpdesk@griffith.ie>
Phone: (01) 415 0499
Or visit griffith.ie/it for more information.

<span style='color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;'>No.</span>

**Explanation:** The Admin Info.docx clearly states the Wi-Fi password as:

Gr1ff1thColl3g3
(Please note that this can be subject to change.)

The answer incorrectly states that the password isn't provided and overemphasizes Eduroam without acknowledging the simpler Wi-Fi option mentioned directly in the admin document.

## 17. What services are available through the MyGriffith portal?

Based on the provided context, the MyGriffith portal offers the following services and information:

MyGriffith User Account Management

It doesn't have single sign-on, so you'll need your separate username and password .
However, It does not include accessing courses or IT services, as those would be accessed via other platforms like Moodle and the IT services portal respectively.

<span style='color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;'>Yes.</span>

---

## 18. What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and how do I set it up?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security process where you need to provide two forms of verification to access certain College systems, such as your College email and Moodle. It is mandatory to ensure that your account and the College network are secure. This typically involves something you know (like your password) and something you have (like your mobile phone).

To set up MFA, you will need to follow these steps:

Install the MS Authenticator App: Download and install the MS Authenticator app on your mobile phone.

Complete the Setup: Follow the instructions provided on the "Email and Office 365 | Griffith College" page to complete the MFA setup. This usually involves linking the MS Authenticator app to your College email account.

For detailed guidance, you can refer to the instructions on the Email and Office 365 | Griffith College website. If you encounter any issues, you may need to contact the helpdesk or IT support for further assistance.

I'm not sure if there is specific instruction outside of this context.

<span style='color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;'>Yes.</span>

## 19. What counts as a deferral, and how can students apply for one?

At Griffith College, a deferral allows a student to postpone certain aspects of their academic program. There are three types of deferrals:

Type 2: Postponement of an entire academic year of a program after registration until the next available commencement.
Module Deferral:

Postponement of one or more modules (both attendance and assessment) until the next available commencement. This option is generally not available to full-time learners.
Assessment Deferral:

Postponement of the assessment for one or more modules until the next available sitting.
Applying for a Deferral:
To apply for a deferral, students should follow these steps:

Read the Policy: First, students must read section 3.16 in the QAE (Quality Assurance and Enhancement) Manual to understand the policy and the process involved.
Download the Form: Obtain a Learner Record Amendment Form (LRAF) from Moodle.
Submit the Form: Submit the completed form to the relevant faculty for approval by the Programme Director.

Additional Notes:
Duration of Deferral:
Programme and module deferrals are granted for one year only.
Assessment deferrals are granted for one semester only.
Reapplication:
Students can apply to return and continue their studies within 5 years from their last registration. After 5 years, reapplication through the College’s application process is required.
Appeal:
If a deferral request is unsuccessful, students have the right to appeal the decision.

<span style='color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;'>Yes.</span>

## 20. What is the minimum pass mark for modules?

The minimum pass mark for modules is typically 40%. However, for some programs, including postgraduate programs, the pass mark is 50%. To determine the specific pass mark for your program, you should refer to your Programme Handbook or contact your Faculty Administrator.

Additionally, if your module is assessed by more than one component (such as an assignment, project, examination, etc.), you generally need to pass each component to pass the module.

<span style='color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;'>No.</span>

**Explanation:** The minimum pass mark across Griffith College modules is consistently 40%, including for postgraduate programmes, according to the provided context. The mention of 50% for some programmes is not supported by the documents and could mislead students. The rest of the answer regarding multiple assessment components is correct.

---

## 21. Are assignment extensions allowed?

According to the provided context, Griffith College generally does not grant extensions for assignments "other than in exceptional circumstances." Therefore, extensions are typically not allowed, but there may be specific situations where an exception could be made. If you believe you have an exceptional circumstance, you should contact your faculty to discuss the possibility of an extension.

<span style='color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;'>Yes.</span>

---

## 22. What is Turnitin used for?

Based on the provided context, Turnitin is used to "evaluate academic integrity." It is a software resource where students should attach a coversheet to both hard copy and soft copy (submitted through Turnitin) assignments, when applicable.

<span style='color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;'>Yes.</span>

---

## 23. What items are prohibited during exams?

During exams at Griffith College, the following items are prohibited:

mobile phones
computer hardware/software
smart devices
earphones/headphones/earplugs
notes of any kind
programmable calculators
textbooks (unless approved by your faculty)
Additionally, you should not bring items of value or importance, and you should not leave them outside in bags or coats. Any unauthorized material found in your possession in an exam venue will be confiscated immediately, and your actions may be construed as an attempt at cheating, which is major academic misconduct.

<span style='color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;'>Yes.</span>

---

## 24. What is the grading scale at Griffith College?

Griffith College uses different grading scales depending on the program level. Here are the details:

Pass Provisional (PPA): <50%

<span style='color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;'>Yes.</span>

---

## 25. What does a provisional result mean?

A provisional result means that the results are preliminary and subject to confirmation. In the context provided, it indicates that the exam results have been released but have not yet been officially approved by the relevant examinations board. This means that the results could potentially change before they are finalized. Transcripts of the results are issued by the Faculty Administrator in hard copy upon completion of the programme.

In summary, provisional results are not yet officially confirmed and might still be reviewed or adjusted.

<span style='color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;'>Yes.</span>

---

## 26. What is required to pass a module?

To pass a module, you typically need to meet the following requirements:

Overall Pass Mark:

For most programs, you need to achieve a minimum of 40% overall in the module.
For some programs, including postgraduate programs, the pass mark may be 50%. Check your Programme Handbook or contact your Faculty Administrator for specific details.
Component Pass Marks:

If the module is assessed by more than one component (e.g., assignments, projects, examinations), you must pass each component individually.
For example, you need to achieve a minimum of 40% in your assessments and a minimum of 40% in your exams to pass the entire module.
Compensation Rules:

In some cases, you can pass a component by compensation if you have passed all other components within the module and have achieved double the deficit marks required in another module within the same stage.
You must be registered for the module as a first attempt and must not have failed any module within the stage.
Always refer to your Programme Handbook or contact your Faculty Administrator for the most accurate and detailed information regarding your specific program.

<span style='color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;'>No.</span>

**Explanation:** The first point is mostly correct (40% is the pass mark), but again incorrectly claims that some postgraduate programs require 50%, which is not supported by the documents. The explanation of component pass requirements is correct. The "Compensation Rules" section introduces ideas not covered in the provided context, making the answer speculative and potentially misleading.

**Explanation:** The answer confuses the Learner Hub with Library Services and the Learning Support Office, mixing up their roles.

The Learner Hub, as defined in the context, provides:

Access to programme and module info

Class materials and past exam papers

Exam timetables

Academic forms and procedures

College regulations

The listed library and support services are offered elsewhere, not directly through the Learner Hub.

<span style='color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;'>No.</span>

**Explanation:** The majority of the answer is accurate and detailed, but there is a factual error in the last part:

"Train: Sydney Connolly..."

There is no "Sydney Connolly" station. It should be "Dublin Connolly". This typo makes the answer inaccurate. Otherwise, it’s well-structured.

## 47. Are fire drills mandatory to attend?
