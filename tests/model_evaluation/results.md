## Question 1: What is the process for registration at Griffith College?

**RAG Answer:**
To register at Griffith College, you should follow these steps:

1. **Access the Registration Portal**: Go to my.griffith.ie and log in using your provided log-in details.
2. **Follow the Instructions**: Complete the registration process by following the instructions provided on the portal.
3. **Complete Registration**: Once fully registered, you will have access to college resources and can pay your fees, check your personal details, and access information relating to your program.

If you encounter any difficulties with a particular module, your lecturer should be the first person you contact.

Additionally, if you need to make changes to your registration, such as module changes or updates to your attendance records, you should use the Learner Record Amendment Form (LRAF). The Registration Department ensures that Griffith College has full and accurate records relating to your studies.

**Evaluation (automatic):**
The student's answer is "Partially correct" because while the student provides a general outline of the registration process, they do not mention key details, such as the need to access my.griffith.ie for verifying program details and to correct, they imply that the portal is explicitly for registration when it mentions other tasks along with registration.

## Question 3: What happens if I lose access to Moodle?

**RAG Answer:**
If you lose access to Moodle, it is likely due to one of the following reasons:

- There may be an issue with your fees. In this case, you should contact the fees office at studentfees@griffithcollege.ie
- You need to register for the new academic year. An email with a registration link is sent to you for this purpose. After registration, if you still do not have access to Moodle or are missing modules, you should email your course administrator.

Additionally, if you need to access library services and resources, you can do so through the main Library website. You will need your Moodle username and password to access eBooks and other online resources.

**Evaluation (automatic):**
The answer is rated as **"Correct"** because it accurately reflects specific content about losing access to Moodle, including the reasons and steps provided in the context of the retrieved content based on the two documents, including the correct email addresses and instructions.

## Question 8: What is the minimum pass mark for modules?

**RAG Answer:**
To determine the minimum pass mark for modules, you need to refer to your specific programme. In general:

- For many programs, the pass mark is 40%.
- In some programs, including postgraduate programs, the pass mark is 50%.

You can find the specific pass mark for your modules by checking your Programme Handbook or by contacting your Faculty Administrator. In order to pass a module, you must achieve the minimum pass mark in each module, ensuring that you meet the criteria defined in your Programme Handbook.

Additionally, for modules assessed by more than one component (such as assignments, projects, or examinations), you typically need to pass each component individually. For more detailed information, refer to the approved programme schedule as outlined in your programme handbook.

**Evaluation (automatic):**
**Rating**: Correct.
This assessment is accurate as the provided passages explicitly delineate the minimum pass mark for modules, differentiating between 40% and 50% thresholds, and their applicability based on the specific programme.
