## Question 3: What happens if I lose access to Moodle?

**RAG Answer:**
If you lose access to Moodle, it is likely due to one of the following reasons:

1. **Fees Issue**: There might be an outstanding fees issue. In this case, you should contact the fees office at studentfees@griffithcollege.ie.

2. **Technical Issues**: If it's not a fees issue, there might be a technical problem. To resolve this, you should first wait for 48 hours after registration. If you still do not have access to Moodle or are missing modules, you should email your course administrator.

Additionally, if you need to arrange a Zoom meeting or have other queries, you can contact the relevant support services as needed.

**Evaluation (automatic):**
**Rating: Partially correct**

The answer correctly identifies the possibility of a fees issue and the need to contact the appropriate office, but it incorrectly attributes a "technical problem" as a general cause without specifying the context of post-registration access issues mentioned in the source.
